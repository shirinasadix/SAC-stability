# Metal Atom Adsorption on Anatase TiO_2 (101) Surface

This repository contains a compiled executable file (`exec`), along with all relevant DFT data and adsorption energy results for single metal atom adsorption (Ag and Cu) on the anatase TiO_2 (101) surface. 

These data have been used to construct potential energy surfaces (PES) for various metal atoms interacting with the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface across different redox states of the surface.
